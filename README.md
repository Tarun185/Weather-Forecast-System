# Weather-Forecast-System
This project is a Django-based weather application that allows users to search for any city and view its current weather details which includes temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather conditions. The app fetches live data from OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a simple, user-friendly interface. The application keeps track of recent searches, allowing users to quickly see their last 5 searched cities along with their weather details. The project demonstrates how to integrate external APIs, use Django models for data storage, and create dynamic templates. OpenWeatherMap API can be used to wide range of global environmental and weather data into their web applications, enterprise systems, and specialized industry solutions.
